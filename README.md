# Codename Calamity
**Introduction**

Codename: Calamity is a high concept, deeply complex journey through actions, conseequences and inevitability. It has a heavy focus on environmental catastrophee, the limited time available for a species to adapt to those sorts of changes, and the inability to change the past.

I'll expand here later but expanding too much gives the game away, so to speak, so this is how the repo is laid out. Everything here is extremely rough and a work in progress.

**Layout**

*Maps*

In Visio and in .PDF formats. The file names indicate where they slot in within the width of the entire game and the file 0. Odyssey represents that map. Like many games of its type, the game goes from left to right literally with respect to progress between parts/chapters and up/down/all around within each chapter. The advent of time travel mechanics means that the maps will look different between time periods. These aren't drawn yet.

*Script*

I'm using a few tools. I use Final Draft because it gives me a whole heap of features I know I will find useful like character beats, scene summaries and colour charting. It will be what the final game is completely written in. It is called and will always be called 'Codename Calamity.fdx'

For drafting pure writing I am using FocusWriter and then I'm dumping each part of that file in to markdown files per part. The overall file for this writing will always be called 'Codename Calamity.odt' and each part will be named 'Part {Number in Roman Numerals} - {Part Name}.md'

Lastly, those mark down files are there to easily read and skim on GitHub, where this project will be hosted

*Sprites*

Will eventually include all of these game assets.

*Rooms*

This is a set of game assets and markdown files for every room in the game, split in to subfolders per part.

*Characters*

A markdown file for each character. This is the character bible, complete with the species, age, gender, living status, profession, relationships, traits, allies, rivals, sins, virtues and personality. 

Beats are included where integral and linked back by reference to the events that lead to them.
