Reptillians ruled planet
Odyssians invaded
Wiped out 80% of Reptile population
20% were enslaved then freed and given some land
Humans came, had oil to trade, were given part of that land
    
Rather than break out in war, civil war broke out about remaining land for Reptillians
    Two factions were formed, the second came out of a failed coup on the tribe of Hope by the Generla of the Tribe
    New Hope was formed as a result and war has been waged ever since
Reptiles formed two tribes at constant war without enough resources
Planet started running out of resources
Scientists invented calamity detection technology, dedicated 100% calamity probability (called incident in main community) believed to be around resources and warming
    Gamma invented the detection technology but only a basic version that the Odyssians officially had, he perfected better version with more capacity and time travel capacity in two directions
    Detection technology is called NOSTRA and detects calamities and other events, similar to say, Minority Report
Resistance formed skeptical of official Odyssian response which was a machine based around energy preservation and reinvigoration they believed to be smokescreen
