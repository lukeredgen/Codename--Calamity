# Part IV - A New Hope# Odyssey RdThe Reptilians who came across you were skeptical of your story, but everybody knows you. They are of the belief that you can save them and so they free you from the Resistance and bring you back to their base. The two that collect you are Wiery, the personal assistant and right hand woman of Fauval (the leader of the tribe, and original leader of the joint tribes) and his friend (unnamed for now).They explain through dialogue exposition as to why they are helping you but they are still skeptical and nervous.“Where are you taking me now? This is starting to become insane, I know none of you and what your issues are with me and I demand some answers. Three times now I’ve changed hands to become a prisoner.”“Please, you are not our prisoner. You are in chains because they placed you in to them and we have not the tools or expertise to free you of them right now. When we get back to the camp, we’ll get you out of those. We’re here to free you, not to capture. That maybe you might help.”# Hope Rd“Well... that’s yet to be seen, either your freeing me or your helping me. But even if you are honest I don’t see how I am going to be much help to you or anyone, I have a very specific goal and it is very important...”“We know, ironic that you are a prisoner of people that wish to solve the same problems you wish to solve. We wish you all the luck in the world, but saving it? You and your Odyssian chums have made that perfectly impossible now. And we will let you get back to it, hell, if you can’t help us or you aren’t willing, you can go free. But we are here to free you and it seems reasonable that you at least hear us out.”# Tribe CampYou arrive at the camp with the leaders each sitting at their respective stones and Fauval in the centre stone. Eight leaders surround Fauval, four on each side, all old and wise. Fauval motions you towards the stone in the centre of the camp area.“Long time no see, my dear old friend. Let Lenny here help you with your restraints... you could at least pretend to be happy to see me.”“Forgive me, this isn’t the first time today but... I have no idea who you are, who anybody here is. I don’t remember a damn thing and so you can imagine the frustration I’m feeling right now given there is one extremely important thing I need to do...”“I know, I know “Fauval, I love you buddy, but me and Disco are off to save the world.”, and how’s that going for you? In chains and restrained by a group that kind of stole your shtick... no memory huh? Yep, sure sounds like Disco. Old habits, hey?”“Obviously, everything you just said sounds meaningless to me but... guess I still got my feelings, emotions. I believe you.”Lenny cuts your restraints off as promised and as he touches you gently on the shoulder with a smile you feel the connection and smile back.“Alright, but what can I do for you? I have no memories, I don’t know you or your tribe here or your friends or your predicament and I’m guessing the short and sweet version is likely to lack the nuance necessary for me to solve all your issues.”“Hey, if you can save the whole wide world, this little patch should be a cakewalk. And if you think about it, starting small, this is one part of the world. Where are you headed anyway?”You look back at the most recent correspondence with Gamma again, the note that he left you during your escape explains that you must head to New New London Castle and speak to the King.“New New London... funnily enough, I feel like that’s home.”“Indeed it is buddy. And if you could remember correctly, a home you abandoned, barely surviving with the ferry out indefinitely and Destry’s army kinda sorta ready to slaughter you in seconds and without even a credit’s worth of bounty. Betraying them like that... it was awesome buddy, I owe you big time. And I’ll owe you even bigger time because here’s the thing. That castle, there’s only one way out, and as far as segways go one won’t get you there. The bridge is patrolled constantly.”“And that’s your problem? What’s on the other side?”“Peace, brother. Resource sharing, no more bloodshed, the things that you told me once you would fix for me, you promised me. But I am peaceful. You want to turn around, try your luck melting a decade’s worth of ice in the ferry tunnel, head back to Odyssey, fine by me.”The council murmur to themselves, some mentioning that you should be held to your promise by force, a rabble arousing. Fauval shouts for them to cool it“I mean it. That’s who I am P, always have been, always will be. You know that, deep down, no matter what Disco bikkies G got you on that’s tripping your memory balls, I know you and you know me, and this is it. This matters. And you care.”He is right, you feel it again and immediately begin to consider the situation. Here is where you need information to start really feeding DAMUS“We need to go to the park, I can explain from there. Elders, tribe, remain. Just P and me, like old times buddy.”Wiery starts to follow“Just P and me. I know your eager to help, but trust me on this one. I think I know what’s going on here.”You follow and walk back down the road towards the park.# Hope Rd“That machine, the one that you have with you right now. I know nobody can know about it, I trust you guys. I really, really do. I know G was funny about it, that he didn’t want you messing with it but here’s the thing. He told me that by the time you got back here, despite everything we’d talked about, despite you telling me you’d save us only to have him talk you out of it... that if I agreed, if I let it go, you’d come back and save us. I couldn’t tell you then, he couldn’t tell you then. But you gotta trust me buddy. He told me to tell you this. That photo you have in your pocket, turn it over. See on the back, that little paw print... it’s mine buddy,”# Hope Park AveYou arrive at the park
