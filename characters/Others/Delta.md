* Omega’s dog
* He is swapped as your first real act of consequence in going back in time (before your first major act of murder)
* Swapping him is intentional as he plays a pivotal role in Gamma’s inability to stop Tauran
* This is one of the time change sequences in the game that you both can and have to do and undo in order to complete the game
