# Details

* Chief scientist for Alpha
* You kill him as your first serious action for Gamma based on his instructions
* This prevents him launching his machine and saving humanity
* At first we believe this is because Gamma is evil and wanted to be King despite potentially destroying the Universe (the fact this never quite makes sense is fully intentional, it’s never supposed to sit completely right with you)
* He wishes to use his own machine, with a higher probability of success but for a much lower rate of survival (1%)
* You knew this, it’s why your memory was wiped
* You agreed to have it wiped...........
