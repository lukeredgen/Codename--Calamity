# Details

* At first the primary antagonist, Gamma turns you against Alpha to try and save the world
* Although lied to, it would achieve Gamma's goal, since preventing Tauran and Delta hasn't given Gamma enough certainty to execute his plan
* Alpha is demonized by Gamma calling his worship a cult of personality, explaining the resistance resist him, which they do, but blindly
* He's stated as an oppressive liar and tyrant
* In reality, he was the greatest leader the world had known and was about to save the world from his son, Gamma, who he loved but knew the flaws in
* Your killing of Alpha is irreversible, although teased consistently as almost possible. Killing him is the game's primary protagonist tragedy and is emphasised by the ugly state of the world without him
* That world sees Gamma as a severely flawed king who is killed and deposed by Beta
* King Beta has a rule that seems better and Gamma has requested you save him from prison and kill him
* Omega insists you free him to save the world from Gamma and allow Beta to become King
